                An enthusiastic 23-year-old with the necessary drive and determination needed to architect networks to a scalable, resilient, reliable, and secure standard to adhere to the well-architected framework.
                I have effective organisational skills and a passion for maintaining excellent knowledge of past, present and future cloud technologies such as Serverless.
                
                Having already obtained my CCNA and several CompTIA certifications, I have just completed my 4 AWS certifications including the Solutions Architect Professional. My AWS studies included extensive amounts of practical projects such as creating serverless workflows using Lambda, SQS, API Gateway etc and I am now ready to kickstart my career as a Solutions Architect.
                In return, I can offer a can-do attitude to each and every problem/task thrown my way and when combined with my youthful passion, I feel that I can become a valuable asset to a company.
                
                My previous 3 years of work experience, although not entirely related to the position of a Solutions Architect but I feel would add value to, has primed me to be a strong team player with excellent soft skills and I am looking forward to maturing these at a company.
